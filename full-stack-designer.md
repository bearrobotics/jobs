# Bear Robotics, Inc. ...

Bear Robotics, Inc. is a Silicon Valley (Sunnyvale, CA) startup founded by a team of ex-Googlers, Roboticists and Restaurateurs who have the vision  to reshape the labor-intensive restaurant industry by using Robotics, Vision, and AI. We dream of the days where robots and humans interact closely together to increase people's customer experience as well as to improve the working quality of employees and employers.
We have great team members and investors and we know the market from our own experience. We are hiring exceptional self-motivated pioneers who want to join us on our way to become leaders in Industry 4.0.

## In-house Full-stack Product and User Experience Designer (m/f)
Yes. You read it right! We are looking for a product designer with a strong focus on product development. A robot working in crowded areas requires lots of breakthroughs not only in technology but also the design. We have the idea, we have the engineers and software developers and we are currently working on our first prototype. And therefore we are looking for a genius designer who knows how to give a feel-good human-machine interaction the right shape. As our product has never existed in the world before we need your creative mind to bring our complex product into a user friendly, universal and easy to use design so that both customers and employees get a great experience in using our robot. 
Furthermore, you will be involved into sketching concept designs, leading the project with the design firm, making modifications on the output, communicating with the engineers and restaurant employees, testing the prototype in its future natural environment and be up to date with new tools and technologies to constantly improve our product to the latest standards. 
Ideally you have restaurant or hospitality experience and you are happy working hands-on together with the restaurant employees and robots, and later melt their experience and new requirements into the product. 

### Requirements
* Bachelor's degree or higher in Industrial Design, Product Design or similar 
* Consumer focussed product design experience
* Proficient in using SolidWorks
* Passion about food and the hospitality / restaurant industry
* Good communication skills especially in English
* US work permit

### Location
* Sunnyvale, CA
