# Bear Robotics, Inc.

Bear Robotics, Inc. is a Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, CA) based ex-Googler startup
reshaping the labor-intensive restaurants using Robotics, Vision, and AI.  We
have great team members, investors and good understanding of the market. We
dream of the days where robots and humans interact closely to improve the
quality of human life for customers as well as employees and employers.  We are
hiring exceptional self-motivated pioneers to be the leader of Industry 4.0.

## In-house Full-stack Designer
Yes. You read it right! We are looking for a full-stack "designer".
We would like to have a genius designer to get involved in from the beginning
of the product development. This is essential to understand the product that has
never been existed in the world, and come up with the best design a human can
come up with. A robot working in a crowded area requires lots of breakthroughs
not only the technology but also the design of the shape and the interaction
with humans. We expect the designer to get their hands dirty in restaurant
operation, working together with the restaurant employees and later on melt
their experience into the product.

### Requirements
* Bachelors degree in design
* Consumer product design experience
* Passion about food
* Must outperform our own robots
* Driver license (to drive between the office and the restaurants carrying the robots)
* US work permit.

### Location
* Sunnyvale, CA
