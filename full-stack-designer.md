# Bear Robotics, Inc. ...

Bear Robotics, Inc. is a Silicon Valley (Sunnyvale, CA) based ex-Googler startup
reshaping the labor-intensive restaurants using Robotics, Vision, and AI.  We
have great team members, investors and good understanding of the market. We
dream of the days where robots and humans interact closely to improve the
quality of human life for customers as well as employees and employers.  We are
hiring exceptional self-motivated pioneers to be the leader of Industry 4.0.

## In-house Full-stack Industrial Designer
Yes. You read it right! We are looking for a full-stack "industrial designer".
We would like to have a genius designer to get involved from the beginning
of the product development. This is essential to understand the product that has
never existed in the world, and come up with the best design possible.
A robot working in crowded areas requires lots of breakthroughs
not only in technology but also the design of the shape and the interaction
with humans (both customers and employees). We expect the designer to get their
hands dirty in restaurant operations, working together with the restaurant
employees and robots, and later melt their experience into the product.

You should be able to sketch concept designs, lead the project with the design
firm, make modifications on the output, communicate with the engineers and
restaurant employees.

### Requirements
* Bachelors degree in design
* Consumer product design experience
* Proficient in using SolidWorks
* Passion about food
* Good communication skills
* US work permit.

### Location
* Sunnyvale, CA
